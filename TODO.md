# TODO:
- organize TODOs
- ~~changelog~~
- usage section (get-help)
- configure log levels
    - How do Levels Works?
    	- A log request of level p in a logger with level q is enabled if p >= q.
		- This rule is at the heart of log4j. It assumes that levels are ordered.
		- For the standard levels, we have ALL < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < OFF.
- session expiration time?
- ldap objects?
- import-export operation (json object please!!!)
	- unit test exporting to ~~csv~~ JSON (!) and re-importing it to compare objects
- ~~replace ISIM by ISVG IM~~
- endpoints.psm1: SSL checker
	- Test ICMP - add property to force IPv4 or IPv6
	- Test self-signed certs
	- ~~Add support for others security protocols (property files)~~
	- ~~ServerCertificateValidationCallback	=	true~~
		- ~~This property allows to run non-secure without any kind of validation~~
		- ~~Purpose:~~
		    - ~~If SSL, bypass it~~
- [utils_properties]::build_endpoints: validate ip_or_hostname input
- error handlers
	- Maybe a method/function to avoid repeat the same 5 catch lines?
	- [utils_properties]
	- [utils_log]
	- [utils_connections]
	- [utils_proxy_wrapper]
- Structural definitions
	- ~~Should endpoints have a proxy_list? Gonna think it in the future (my_endpoint.proxy_list.session , my_endpoint.proxy_list.roles , my_endpoint.proxy_list.person).~~ NO.
